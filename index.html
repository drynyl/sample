	<h1>Top 3 Fighter Jets in the World</h1>

	<p class="first_par">
		Modern stealth aircraft first became possible when Denys Overholser,<br>
		a mathematician working for Lockheed Aircraft during the 1970s,<br>
		adopted a mathematical model developed by Petr Ufimtsev, a Soviet<br>
		scientist, to develop a computer program called Echo 1. Echo made<br>
		it possible to predict the radar signature of an aircraft made with<br>
	</p>
	<p class="second_par">
		flat panels, called facets. In 1975, engineers at Lockheed Skunk Works<br>
		found that an aircraft made with faceted surfaces could have a very <br>
		ow radar signature because the surfaces would radiate almost all<br>
		of the radar energy away from the receiver. Lockheed built a model<br>
		called "the Hopeless Diamond", a reference to the famous Hope Diamond<br>
    </p>
    <p class="third_par">
		and the design's predicted instability. Because advanced computers<br>
		were available to control the flight of even a Hopeless Diamond,<br>
		for the first time designers realized that it might be possible<br>
		to make an aircraft that was virtually invisible to radar
